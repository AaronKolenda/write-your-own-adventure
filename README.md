This project is meant to use every feature of the Backbone.js framework, including models, routers, views, sync, and collections. It is a Choose Your Own Adventure-style book editor. The user can create pages in book, with action-based links to other book pages ("if you want to do X, turn to page Y").

Each page has

* a title
* text-based content 
* one or more links to other pages - each link has a description and a page number

Users can:

* See a table of contents, or a list of all "pages"
* See the content on an existing page
* Create new pages
* Edit existing pages
* Delete existing pages
